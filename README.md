## What is Assistly?

Assistly is your AI friend in the Chrome extension. With it you can use all the features available in Gemini 1.5, so you don't lose anything.

## What needs to be done to make this project work:

- **Generate and add the Gemini API in the API_KEY line.**
- **Add a section in the JS file responsible for ensuring that the content from the “textarea” when you click send, is sent and processed by the API, and then the response must be displayed on the chat.**
- **Add a section responsible for analyzing images by AI.**
